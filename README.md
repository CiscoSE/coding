## Scripts to Rule Them All

Want to make your coding project easier for others to work with?  Why not adopt our Cisco SE ["Scripts to Rule Them All"](script/) `script/` structure and naming convention?

## Reference Files

This repo will also contain reference files and code samples in connection with the [Cisco SE Coding Practices Wiki](https://github.com/CiscoSE/coding-practices/wiki) and as otherwise may benefit the Cisco SE community as we work to collect, document and share our coding practices with each other.  Feel free to browse the repo.  Each topical sub-folder should contain a README file that will describe its contents and purpose.
